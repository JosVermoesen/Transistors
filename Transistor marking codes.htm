                  We are lucky with transistors that, apart from a few oddities which I'll talk
                  about later, most markings follow one of these codes.
                  ICs are more tricky as you're often dealing with custom chips or mask
                  programmed devices with manufacturers individual codes.
                  A quick hint though: always look for known numbers (eg 723, 6502, 2764) etc
                  between the suffix and prefix, and beware of the date code.

                  Right, back to transistors. The three standard transistor marking schemes are:

                  <b>
                    1. Joint Electron Device Engineering Council (JEDEC).
                  </b>                  
                  These take the form:
                  
                  digit, letter, serial number, [suffix]
                  where the letter is always 'N'

                  the first digit is one less than the number of legs, (2 for transistors unless
                  they're crippled although I'm not sure about 4 legged transistors maybe they
                  get a 3) except for 4N and 5N which are reserved for optocouplers.
                  
                  The serial number runs from 100 to 9999 and tell nothing about the transistor
                  except its approximate time of introduction.

                  The (optional) suffix indicates the gain (hfe) group of the device:

                    A = low gain
                    B = medium gain
                    C = high gain
                    No suffix = ungrouped (any gain).

                  See the data sheet for the actual gain spread and groupings.
                  The reason for gain grouping is that the low gain devices are fractionally
                  cheaper than the high gain devices, resulting in savings for high volume users.

                  Examples-  2N3819, 2N2221A, 2N904.

                  <b>
                    2. Japanese Industrial Standard (JIS).
                  </b>                  
                  These take the form:

                  digit, two letters, serial number, [suffix]
                  
                  Again, the digit is one less than the number of legs.

                  The letters indicate the applicatin area and flavour of the device according
                  to the following code:

                  SA:	PNP HF transistor	SB:	PNP AF transistor
                  SC:	NPN HF transistor	SD:	NPN AF transistor
                  SE:	Diodes			SF:	Thyristors
                  SG:	Gunn devices		SH:	UJT
                  SJ:	P-channel FET/MOSFET	SK:	N-channel FET/MOSFET
                  SM:	Triac			SQ:	LED
                  SR:	Rectifier		SS:	Signal diodes
                  ST:	Avalanche diodes	SV:	Varicaps
                  SZ:	Zener diodes

                  The serial number runs from 10-9999.

                  The (optional) suffix ndicates that the type is approved for use by various
                  Japanese organisations.

                  NOTE. since the code for transistors always begins with 2S, it is sometimes
                  (more often than not is seems) ommitted so, for example, a 2SC733 would be
                  marked C 733.

                  Examples-  2SA1187, 2SB646, 2SC733.
                  
                  <b>
                    3. Pro-electron.
                  </b>
                  These take the form:

                  two letters, [letter], serial number, [suffix]

                  The first letter indicates the material:
                    A = Ge
                    B = Si
                    C = GaAs
                    R = compound materials.

                  Needless to say the biggest majority of transistors begin with a B.

                  The second letter indicates the device application:

                  A:	Diode RF		B: Variac
                  C:	transistor, AF, small signal
                  D:	transistor, AF, power
                  E:	Tunnel diode
                  F:	transistor, HF, small signal
                  K:	Hall effect device
                  L:	Transistor, HF, power
                  N:	Optocoupler
                  P:	Radiation sensitive device
                  Q:	Radiation producing device
                  R:	Thyristor, Low power
                  T:	Thyristor, Power
                  U:	Transistor, power, switching
                  Y:	Rectifier
                  Z:	Zener, or voltage regulator diode

                The third letter indicates that the device is intended for industrial or
                professional rather than commercial applications. It is usually a W,X,Y or Z.

                The serial number runs from 100-9999.

                The suffix indicates the gain grouping, as for JEDEC.

                Examples-  BC108A, BAW68, BF239, BFY51.
                
                Apart from JEDEC, JIS and Pro-electron, manufacturers often introduce their
                own types, for commercial reasons (ie to get their name into the code) or to
                emphasise that the range belongs to a specialist application.
                
                Common brand specific prefixes are:

                  MJ:	Motorolla power, metal case
                  MJE:	Motorolla power, plastic case
                  MPS:	Motorolla low power, plastic case
                  MRF:	Motorolla HF, VHF and microwave transistor
                  RCA:	RCA
                  RCS:	RCS
                  TIP:	Texas Instruments power transistor (platic case)
                  TIPL:	TI planar power transistor
                  TIS:	TI small signal transistor (plastic case)
                  ZT:	Ferranti
                  ZTX:	Ferranti

                Examples-  ZTX302, TIP31A, MJE3055, TIS43.

                Many manufacturers also make custom parts for large volume OEM use.
                These parts are optimised for use in a given part of a given circuit.
                They usually just have a manufacturers stamp and an untraceable number.
                Often when a company goes bankrupt, or has surplus at the end of a
                production run, these transistors find their way into hobbyist bargain packs.
                There is no way that you can trace data on these devices, so they are only
                suitable as LED drivers, buffers, etc, where the actual parameters are not 
                important. Check carefully before buying.

                Once you have identified your part, a trip to the data sheet or equivalents
                book is called for (anyone know of an on-line equivalents list?).
